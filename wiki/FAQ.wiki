== I'm getting API errors! What's wrong? ==

More often than not, this means that Twitter is currently having problems. Dabr very rarely changes and hardly ever breaks. There are a handful of good places to check for more information that might hint why things are broken on their end:

  * http://status.twitter.com
  * http://twitter.com/TwitterAPI
  * http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk

== Can Dabr filter out Tweets that I don't want to see? ==

Short answer: no. If Dabr tried to filter out certain tweets or hashtags, it would merely show _less_ tweets, as opposed to more relevant tweets. If all your friends were tweeting about a filtered hashtag at once, you would see no tweets on the page at all - which is fairly useless.

== How do I retweet? ==

Retweet (or RT) is the quote icon, 4th one along.

== How do I delete a tweet? ==

Since this function is so rare, I hid it away a bit. Click on the time beside your tweet to see the delete button.

== How long can a Direct Message be? ==

When I first developed Dabr, I wasn't aware there was a limit. It turns out the _official_ limit is 140 characters but the _real_ limit is something around 255 characters.

== How can I help the project? ==

Dabr is a hobby project of mine that I work on in my spare time. I'm happy to accept feature suggestions, patches, and any constructive criticism. The project has been configured to allow anyone to submit code reviews - letting you to quickly make comments about the code straight through this project site. I am particularly interested in any comments and suggestions you have about code in Dabr branches, where things are a bit more experimental.

== I'm getting errors about mcrypt ==

That's one of the requirements specified in the SetupGuide, your server needs to have mcrypt installed. Talk to your server administrator and ask them to install it.

== I only see one tweet per page ==

This was hopefully fixed in r142 of the code. It's because Twitter has _lots_ of tweets, more than 2147483647 of them in fact. That number is the limit of an integer on 32-bit systems and PHP can't count higher than that. Newer versions of Dabr treat those large numbers as strings instead.
